A study on the effectiveness of different neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset.

Identifying what digit is represented in an image is a perceptual problem that proves to be very well handled by neural networks. Therefore, through two simple regularized neural network architectures (one Dense NN and a Convolutional NN), we will try to figure out which one performs best on the dataset.

Although it is reasonable to assume the Convolutional architecture will perform better on this task (since it is "translationally invariant and can discover hierarchical patterns," as written by Francois Chollet), it is nonetheless interesting as a provocative experiment, as well as a good training challenge.
